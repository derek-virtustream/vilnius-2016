                OpenStack HEAT is a flexible and extensible orchestration tool which allows
                you to use your OpenStack IaaS to repeatably deploy clusters of
                servers, networks, services, and other infrastructure.

                step through a series of examples, growing in
                complexity, from deploying a single VM, up
                to deploying a complex, multi-VM

                    specific language with a very brief example
                    that deploys a single VM from the Horizon
                    dashboard.

                <p>Heat wouldn't be very useful if you had to load the UI every time you
                wanted to launch a stack (well, actually that's <i>still</i> pretty awesome). 
                Fortunately, OpenStack has both a rest API, and a CLI that targets it. Between
                these two, it's easy to automate your Heat stack deployments. Great for testing, 
                CI/CD, deploy on demand for your customers, etc.

                <h1>Example 3: Parameters</h1>
                <p>
                While the templates we have used so far are nice for getting the
                same VM build every time, they aren't terribly reusable outside of
                a very narrow scope. They also aren't very useful for more complex
                landscapes of servers.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>
                To allow for better reusability and flexibility, HOT templates can
                have parameters, which allow us to create
                <i>customizable</i> templates that allow for better reuse.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>
                There is also the option of creating string <i>resources</i> which can be
                used to specify autogenerated values, as well as the infrastructure components
                that we have seen in previous examples. We'll use both in the template below.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>In this example, we're going to add three new parameters to the template:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                      An SSH key name, so that we can change the default SSH key that is installed
                      on the new instance. This allows us to redeploy the VM for use by different
                      users.
                    </li>
                    <li class="fragment">
                      An Image identifier. This allows us to redeploy the same template with
                      different base images.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                       A private network identifier. This gives us the option of targeting
                       different private networks for deployment. This will allow you to redeploy
                       this same template in your own environments, just changing this <i>name</i>
                       to match the one in your tenant's resources.

                <p>Using the same YAML that you use to provision infrastructure,
                    OpenStack Heat has a variety of methods of generating useful strings, which you
                    can use for a variety of purposes. In this case, a nonce is of the type OS::Heat::RandomString,
                    which allows us to repeatedly deploy the same HEAT template into the same
                    Tenant/Project without having a naming collision. This is very useful when you
                    are deploying a variety of VMs and want to keep them organized together by name
                    too.

                <p>
                Now that we're provisioning our VMs programmatically, wouldn't it be nice if
                we could _customize_ them so that we could change them automatically in
                some way from the stock template?
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>
                Turns out we're in luck! Heat provides
                access to the _user data_ feature that's available to provision VM instances,
                and even better, provides a _templating_ language that allows us to
                customize the _user data_ based on our parameters and other resources.

                In this example, we'll create the same VM as in the previous iteration, but

                Then we'll add a template that contains placeholders for the values we want
                to replace. This looks a lot like string interpolation in other languages.

                deploying SaltStack, but if you would rather use Puppet, Chef, Ansible,
                or some other engine, you could use the same approach.
