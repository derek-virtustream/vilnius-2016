# Prerequisites

## Hardware
Everything in these lessons will work on a desktop/server/laptop that has at
least the following minimum capabilities.

* 8GB RAM
* 512GB Hard disk
* Reasonably modern CPU with VT/VMX
* Preferably running Centos 7.x directly, but can also be a VMWare VM.

## Software
The OpenStack VM should be running Centos 7.x with Redhat
[RDO](https://www.rdoproject.org/). I prefer to run the most recent
version (Mitaka at the time I am writing this).
If you are going to run as a VM, I _strongly_ recommend VMWare workstation
with the ability to use nested VT. Other hypervisors have much worse
performance.

I will provide a VM image in advance of the conference, so that you don't
have to build your own instance. The download image will be linked here
for download on Friday before the conference.
