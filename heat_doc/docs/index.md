# Introduction to OpenStack HEAT : DevOpsPro 2016

OpenStack HEAT is a flexible and extensible orchestration tool which allows
you to use your OpenStack IaaS to repeatably deploy clusters of
servers, networks, services, and other infrastructure.

## UPDATE:
The entire presentation, all dependencies, and source are available
at [Github](https://github.com/derek-virtustream/vilnius-2016).

All the files you need are listed below.

Please look at the [VMWare](vmware.md) page and get your VMWare based
OpenStack up and running to be ready for the workshop.

If you don't have a laptop with the [pre-requisites](prerequisites.md), that's
OK. I will be pacing the workshop so that you can follow along. The laptop
and VM is not mandatory, and I will be doing live demo deployments throughout
the demo.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can email me at:
[derek+devopspro2016@armyofevilrobots.com](mailto:derek+devopspro2016@armyofevilrobots.com)

## FILES:

* UPLOADING: OpenStack VMW Image [Centos7-Openstack-Mitaka.vmwarevm.tar.gz](devops-pro-2016.armyofevilrobots.com/Centos7-Openstack-Mitaka.vmwarevm.tar.gz)...
  is complete and ready to install. See the [vmware](vmware.md) page for more
  details.
* [minimal_salt_centos_7.2](media/minimal_salt_centos_7.2.qcow2) qcow2 image.
  Included in the VMW image, you won't need to download it unless you have your own openstack.
* [demo_stuff.tar.gz](media/demo_stuff.tar.gz) salt pillars etc. Only required
  if you want to inspect it yourself.

Please also see [Pre-requisites](prerequisites.md) to see if your hardware
is sufficient for the lessons. You don't have to run them live, I'll be pacing
things so that you can just observe and learn.
